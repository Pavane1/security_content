description: The following analytic identifies the resizing of shadowstorage using
  vssadmin.exe to avoid the shadow volumes being made again. This technique is typically
  found used by adversaries during a ransomware event and a precursor to deleting
  the shadowstorage.

search:
  selection1:
    process|contains: shadowstorage
  selection2:
    process|contains: resize
  selection3:
    process|contains: maxsize
  selection4:
    process_name: vssadmin.exe
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: System administrators may resize the shadowstorage for valid
  purposes. Filter as needed.

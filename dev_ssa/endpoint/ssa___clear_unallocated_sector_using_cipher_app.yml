- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process_name: cipher.exe
    process|contains: '/W:'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

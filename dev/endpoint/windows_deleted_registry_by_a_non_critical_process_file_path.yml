name: Windows Deleted Registry By A Non Critical Process File Path

version: 1
date: '2022-03-28'
author: Teoderick Contreras, Splunk
status: production
type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect deletion of registry with suspicious process
  file path. This technique was seen in Double Zero wiper malware where it will delete
  all the subkey in HKLM, HKCU and HKU registry hive as part of its destructive payload
  to the targeted hosts. This anomaly detections can catch possible malware or advesaries
  deleting registry as part of defense evasion or even payload impact but can also
  catch for third party application updates or installation. In this scenario false
  positive filter is needed.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Registry.action: deleted
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the registry value name, registry path, and registry value data from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: This detection can catch for third party application updates
  or installation. In this scenario false positive filter is needed.

description: The following analytic identifies a process command line related to the
  discovery of possible Security Support Providers in the registry. This technique
  is being abused by adversaries or post exploitation tools like winpeas to gather
  LSA protection and configuration in the registry in the targeted host. This registry
  entry can contain several information related to LSA that validates users for local
  and remote sign-ins and enforces local security policies. Understanding LSA protection
  may give a good information in accessing LSA content in memory which is commonly
  attack by adversaries and tool like mimikatz to scrape password hashes or clear
  plain text passwords.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: reg.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: reg.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '* query *'
  selection4:
    CommandLine:
    - '*RunAsPPL*'
    - '*LsaCfgFlags*'
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '*\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4 and selection5
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.

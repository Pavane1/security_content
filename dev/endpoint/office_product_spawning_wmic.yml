description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by Ursnif
  malware family. This detection identifies any Windows Office Product spawning `wmic.exe`.
  In malicious instances, the command-line of `wmic.exe` will contain `wmic process
  call create`. In addition, Threat Research has released a detection identifying
  the use of `wmic process call create` on the command-line of `wmic.exe`. In this
  instance, we narrow our detection down to the Office suite as a parent process.
  During triage, review all file modifications. Capture and analyze any artifacts
  on disk. The Office Product, or `wmic.exe` will have reached out to a remote destination,
  capture and block the IPs or domain. Review additional parallel processes for further
  activity.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.

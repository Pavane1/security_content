description: This analytic will identify the possible execution of ping sleep batch
  commands. This technique was seen in several malware samples and is used to trigger
  sleep times without explicitly calling sleep functions or commandlets. The goal
  is to delay the execution of malicious code and bypass detection or sandbox analysis.
  This  detection can be a good indicator of a process delaying its execution for
  malicious purposes.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Administrator or network operator may execute this command.
  Please update the filter macros to remove false positives.

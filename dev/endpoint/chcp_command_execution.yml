- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    ParentImage: cmd.exe
    Image|endswith: chcp.com
    ParentCommandLine: '*/c*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed chcp.com may be used.

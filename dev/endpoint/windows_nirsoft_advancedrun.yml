description: The following analytic identifies the use of AdvancedRun.exe. AdvancedRun.exe
  has similar capabilities as other remote programs like psexec. AdvancedRun may also
  ingest a configuration file with all settings defined and perform its activity.
  The analytic is written in a way to identify a renamed binary and also the common
  command-line arguments.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: advancedrun.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: advancedrun.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine:
    - '*EXEFilename*'
    - '*/cfg*'
    - '*RunAs*'
    - '*WindowState*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited as it is specific to AdvancedRun.
  Filter as needed based on legitimate usage.

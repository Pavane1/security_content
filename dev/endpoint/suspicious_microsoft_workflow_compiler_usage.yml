description: The following analytic identifies microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe usage.
  microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319
  and is rarely utilized. When investigating, identify the executed code on disk and
  review. It is not a commonly used process by many applications.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe
  condition: (selection1 or selection2)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, limited instances have been identified coming
  from native Microsoft utilities similar to SCCM.

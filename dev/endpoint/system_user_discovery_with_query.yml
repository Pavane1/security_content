description: This analytic looks for the execution of `query.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover the logged user. Red Teams and adversaries alike
  may leverage `query.exe` to identify system users on a compromised endpoint for
  situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*user*'
    Image|endswith: query.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.

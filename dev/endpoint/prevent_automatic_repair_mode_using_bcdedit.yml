description: This search is to detect a suspicious bcdedit.exe execution to ignore
  all failures. This technique was used by ransomware to prevent the compromise machine
  automatically boot in repair mode.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*bootstatuspolicy*'
    Image|endswith: bcdedit.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*ignoreallfailures*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed bcdedit.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Administrators may modify the boot configuration ignore failure
  during testing and debugging.

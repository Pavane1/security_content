description: This analytic detects a suspicious registry modification to disable Windows
  hotkey (shortcut keys) for native Windows applications. This technique is commonly
  used to disable certain or several Windows applications like `taskmgr.exe` and `cmd.exe`.
  This technique is used to impair the analyst in analyzing and removing the attacker
  implant in compromised systems.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Details: HotKey Disabled
    TargetObject: '*\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Image File Execution Options\\*'
    Registry.registry_value_name: Debugger
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as CarbonBlack or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

description: The following analytic identifies "mshta.exe" execution with inline protocol
  handlers. "JavaScript", "VBScript", and "About" are the only supported options when
  invoking HTA content directly on the command-line. The search will return the first
  time and last time these command-line arguments were used for these executions,
  as well as the target system, the user, process "mshta.exe" and its parent process.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: MSHTA.EXE
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: mshta.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine:
    - '*vbscript*'
    - '*javascript*'
    - '*about*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.

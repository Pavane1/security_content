description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to enable
  plain text credential feature of windows. This technique was used by several malware
  and also by mimikatz to be able to dumpe the a plain text credential to the compromised
  or target host. This TTP is really a good indicator that someone wants to dump the
  crendential of the host so it must be a good pivot for credential dumping techniques.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13

  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name: UseLogonCredential
    TargetObject: '*\\System\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\SecurityProviders\\WDigest\\*'
    Details: '0x00000001'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

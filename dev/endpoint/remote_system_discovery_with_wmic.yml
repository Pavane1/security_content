description: This analytic looks for the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The arguments utilized in this command
  return a list of all the systems registered in the domain. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may leverage WMI and wmic.exe to identify remote systems for situational awareness
  and Active Directory Discovery.

  selection1:
    Image|endswith: wmic.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*ds_computer*'

  condition: (selection1) and selection2 and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

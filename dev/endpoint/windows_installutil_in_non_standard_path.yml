type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies the Windows binary InstallUtil.exe
  running from a non-standard location. The analytic utilizes a macro for InstallUtil
  and identifies both the process_name and original_file_name.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: InstallUtil.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: installutil.exe
  condition: (selection1 or selection2)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may be required.
  Certain utilities will run from non-standard paths based on the third-party application
  in use.

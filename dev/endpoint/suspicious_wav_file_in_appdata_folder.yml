description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious creation of .wav file in appdata
  folder. This behavior was seen in Remcos RAT malware where it put the audio recording
  in the appdata\audio folde as part of data collection. this recording can be send
  to its C2 server as part of its exfiltration to the compromised machine. creation
  of wav files in this folder path is not a ussual disk place used by user to save
  audio format file.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Processes.process_path: '*\\appdata\\Roaming\\*'
    Image|endswith: '*.exe'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, file_name, file_path and command-line
  executions from your endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least
  version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.

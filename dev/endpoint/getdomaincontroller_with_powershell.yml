description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. `Get-DomainController` is part of
  PowerView, a PowerShell tool used to perform enumeration on Windows domains. Red
  Teams and adversaries alike may leverage PowerView to enumerate domain groups for
  situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

description: This analytic looks for the execution of `at.exe` with command-line arguments
  utilized to create a Scheduled Task on a remote endpoint. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may abuse the Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code execution.
  The `at.exe` binary internally leverages the AT protocol which was deprecated starting
  with Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012 but may still work on previous versions of
  Windows. Furthermore, attackers may enable this protocol on demand by changing a
  sytem registry key.

search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: at.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: at.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*\\\\*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.

description: The following hunting analytic identifies renamed instances of regsv32.exe
  executing. regsv32.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
  During investigation, validate if it is the legitimate regsv32.exe executing and
  what dll module content it is loading. This query relies on the original filename
  or internal name from the PE meta data. Expand the query as needed by looking for
  specific command line arguments outlined in other analytics.

  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: regsvr32.exe
    Image|endswith: regsvr32.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

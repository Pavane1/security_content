description: The following analytic identifies a process command line that retrieves
  information related to password manager software. This technique was seen in several
  post exploitation tools like winpeas that are being used by Ransomware Prestige
  to gather this type of information. Password Managers applications are designed
  to store user credentials, normally in an encrypted database. Credentials are typically
  accessible after a user provides a master password that unlocks the database. After
  the database is unlocked, these credentials may be copied to memory. These databases
  can be stored as files on disk. Due to this password manager software designed adversaries
  may find or look for keywords related to the Password Manager databases that can
  be stolen or extracted for further attacks.

  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*dir *'
  selection2:
    CommandLine:
    - '*.kdbx*'
    - '*credential*'
    - '*key3.db*'
    - '*pass*'
    - '*cred*'
    - '*key4.db*'

    CommandLine: '*findstr*'
  condition: selection1 or selection2 or selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.

description: This analytic looks for the execution of `wmic.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The arguments utilized in this command
  line return a list of all domain controllers in a Windows domain. Red Teams and
  adversaries alike use *.exe to identify remote systems for situational awareness
  and Active Directory Discovery.

  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*DomainControllerAddress*'
    - ''
    Image|endswith: wmic.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.

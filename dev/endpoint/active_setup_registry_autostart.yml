status: production
type: TTP
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious modification of the active setup
  registry for persistence and privilege escalation. This technique was seen in several
  malware (poisonIvy), adware and APT to gain persistence to the compromised machine
  upon boot up. This TTP is a good indicator to further check the process id that
  do the modification since modification of this registry is not commonly done. check
  the legitimacy of the file and process involve in this rules to check if it is a
  valid setup installer that creating or modifying this registry.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    TargetObject: '*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Active Setup\\Installed Components*'
    Registry.registry_value_name: StubPath
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: Active setup installer may add or modify this registry.

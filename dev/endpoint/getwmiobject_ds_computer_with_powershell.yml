description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to discover remote systems. The `Get-WmiObject` commandlet combined
  with the `DS_Computer` parameter can be used to return a list of all domain computers.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may leverage WMI in this case, using PowerShell,
  to enumerate domain groups for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.

  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.

description: The following analytic identifies a process command line related to the
  discovery of cache domain credential logon count in the registry. This Technique
  was being abused by several post exploitation tool like Winpeas where it query CachedLogonsCount
  registry value in Winlogon registry. This value can be good information about the
  login caching setting on the Windows OS target host. A value of 0 means login caching
  is disable and values > 50 caches only 50 login attempts. By default all versions
  of Windows 10 save cached logins except Windows Server 2008.

search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: reg.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: reg.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '* query *'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon*'
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '*CACHEDLOGONSCOUNT*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4 and selection5
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.

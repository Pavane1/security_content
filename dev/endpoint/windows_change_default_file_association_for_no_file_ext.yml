description: This analytic is developed to detect suspicious process commandline to

  notepad.exe. This technique was seen in some APT and ransomware Prestige where it
  set/modify the default process to run file association, like .txt to notepad.exe.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to query for domain users. The `Get-WmiObject` commandlet combined
  with the `-class ds_user` parameter can be used to return the full list of users
  in a Windows domain. Red Teams and adversaries alike may leverage WMI in this case,
  using PowerShell, to enumerate domain users for situational awareness and Active
  Directory Discovery.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*get-wmiobject*'
    Image|endswith:
    - powershell*
    - cmd.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*ds_user*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*root\\directory\\ldap*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*-namespace*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

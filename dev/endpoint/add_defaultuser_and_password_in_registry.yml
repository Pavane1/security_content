description: this search is to detect a suspicious registry modification to implement
  auto admin logon to a host. This technique was seen in BlackMatter ransomware to
  automatically logon to the compromise host after  triggering a safemode boot to
  continue encrypting the whole network. This behavior is not a common practice and
  really a suspicious TTP or alert need to be consider if found within then network
  premise.

  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name:
    - DefaultPassword
    - DefaultUserName
    TargetObject: '*SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.

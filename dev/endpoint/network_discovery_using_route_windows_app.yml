description: This analytic look for a spawned process of route.exe windows application.
  Adversaries and red teams alike abuse this application the recon or do a network
  discovery on a target host. but one possible false positive might be an automated
  tool used by a system administator or a powershell script in amazon ec2 config services.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: route.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: route.exe
  condition: (selection1 or selection2)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: A network operator or systems administrator may utilize an
  automated host discovery application that may generate false positives or an amazon
  ec2 script that uses this application. Filter as needed.

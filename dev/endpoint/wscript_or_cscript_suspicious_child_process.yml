description: This analytic identifies a suspicious spawned process by WScript or CScript
  process. This technique was a common technique used by adversaries and malware to
  execute different LOLBIN, other scripts like PowerShell or spawn a suspended process
  to inject its code as a defense evasion. This TTP may detect some normal script
  that using several application tool that are in the list of the child process it
  detects but a good pivot and indicator that a script is may execute suspicious code.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Administrators may create vbs or js script that use several
  tool as part of its execution. Filter as needed.

status: production
type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious registry entry created
  by Qakbot malware as part of its malicious execution. This "Binary Data" Registry  was
  created by newly spawn explorer.exe where its malicious code is injected to it.
  The registry consist of 8 random registry value name with encrypted binary data
  on its registry value data. This anomaly detections can be a good pivot for possible
  Qakbot malware infection or other malware that uses registry to save or store there
  config or malicious code on the registry data stream.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.

description: The following analytic detects programs that have been started by forfiles.exe.
  According to Microsoft, the 'The forfiles command lets you run a command on or pass
  arguments to multiple files'. While this tool can be used to start legitimate programs,
  usually within the context of a batch script, it has been observed being used to
  evade protections on command line execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    ParentCommandLine: '*forfiles* /c *'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the full process path in the process field of CIM's Process data model.
  If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the Sysmon TA.
  Tune and filter known instances where  forfiles.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Some legacy applications may be run using pcalua.exe. Similarly,
  forfiles.exe may be used in legitimate batch scripts.  Filter these results as needed.

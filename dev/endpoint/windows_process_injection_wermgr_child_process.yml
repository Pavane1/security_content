type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious wermgr.exe parent process
  having a child process not related to error, fault or windows werfault event. This
  technique was seen in Qakbot malware where it inject its malicious code in wermgr
  to evade detections and hide from the analyst to execute its recon and its malicious
  behavior. This Anomaly detection can be a good pivot to start investigating a possible
  qakbot infection in the network. The Wermgr.exe process is not known to have other
  child processes aside from itself or werfault.exe
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    ParentImage: wermgr.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

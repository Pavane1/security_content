description: This analytic looks for the execution of `net.exe` or `net1.exe` with
  command-line arguments utilized to query for domain users. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may use net.exe to enumerate domain users for situational awareness and Active
  Directory Discovery.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: net.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: net.exe
  selection3:
    Image|endswith: net1.exe
  selection4:
    OriginalFileName: net1.exe
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '* user*'
  selection6:
    CommandLine: '*/do*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2 or selection3 or selection4) and selection5
    and selection6
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.

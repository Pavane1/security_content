description: The following analytic identifies Schtasks.exe creating a new task to
  start and run as an elevated user - SYSTEM. This is commonly used by adversaries
  to spawn a process in an elevated state.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: schtasks.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: schtasks.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*/create *'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*/ru *'
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '*system*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4 and selection5
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to legitimate applications
  creating a task to run as SYSTEM. Filter as needed based on parent process, or modify
  the query to have world writeable paths to restrict it.

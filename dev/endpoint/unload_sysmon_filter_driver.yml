description: Attackers often disable security tools to avoid detection. This search
  looks for the usage of process `fltMC.exe` to unload a Sysmon Driver that will stop
  sysmon from collecting the data.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*unload*'
    Image|endswith: fltMC.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*SysmonDrv*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Processes node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with both the process name and command line from your endpoints.
  The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process" field in the Endpoint data
  model. This search is also shipped with `unload_sysmon_filter_driver_filter` macro,
  update this macro to filter out false positives.
known_false_positives: Unknown at the moment

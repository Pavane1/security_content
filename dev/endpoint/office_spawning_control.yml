description: The following detection identifies control.exe spawning from an office
  product. This detection identifies any Windows Office Product spawning `control.exe`.
  In malicious instances, the command-line of `control.exe` will contain a file path
  to a .cpl or .inf, related to CVE-2021-40444. In this instance, we narrow our detection
  down to the Office suite as a parent process. During triage, review all file modifications.
  Capture and analyze any artifacts on disk. review parallel and child processes to
  identify further suspicious behavior

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

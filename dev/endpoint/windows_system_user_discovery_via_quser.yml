  Host server, Session ID, State of the session (active or disconnected), Idle time
  (the number of minutes since the last keystroke or mouse movement at the session)
  and Date and time the user logged on.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: quser.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: quser.exe
  condition: selection1 or selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.

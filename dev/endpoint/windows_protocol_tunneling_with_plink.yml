description: The following analytic identifies the use of Plink being utilized to
  proxy egress or laterally in an organization. The analytic is limited to specific
  Plink options on the command-line, including -R -L and -D which will have the remote
  and local IP address or port and -l for a username. Modify the options as seen fit
  for your organization.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*-R *'
    - '*-L *'
    - '*-D *'
    - '*-l *'
    OriginalFileName: Plink
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: plink.exe
  condition: selection1 or selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present if the organization allows for
  SSH tunneling outbound or internally. Filter as needed.

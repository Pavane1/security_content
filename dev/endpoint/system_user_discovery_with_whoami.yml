description: This analytic looks for the execution of `whoami.exe` without any arguments.
  This windows native binary prints out the current logged user. Red Teams and adversaries
  alike may leverage `whoami.exe` to identify system users on a compromised endpoint
  for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith: whoami.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.

description: The following analytic identifies suspicious processes spawning from
  WinRM (wsmprovhost.exe). This analytic is related to potential exploitation of CVE-2021-31166.
  which is a kernel-mode device driver http.sys vulnerability. Current proof of concept
  code will blue-screen the operating system. However, http.sys used by many different
  Windows processes, including WinRM. In this case, identifying suspicious process
  create (child processes) from `wsmprovhost.exe` is what this analytic is identifying.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Add new processes or filter as needed. It is possible
  system management software may spawn processes from `wsmprovhost.exe`.

description: The following analytic identifies the odbcconf.exe, Windows Open Database
  Connectivity utility, loading up a resource file. The file extension is arbitrary
  and may be named anything. The resource file itself may have different commands
  supported by Odbcconf to load up a DLL (REGSVR) on disk or additional commands.
  During triage, review file modifications and parallel processes.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*-f *'
    - '*/f *'
    Image|endswith: odbcconf.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*.rsp*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering may need to occur
  based on legitimate application usage. Filter as needed.

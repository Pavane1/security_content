description: The following analytic will identify a Windows Office Product spawning
  WScript.exe or CScript.exe. Tuning may be required based on legitimate application
  usage that may spawn scripts from an Office product.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith:
    - wscript.exe
    - cscript.exe
    ParentImage:
    - winword.exe
    - excel.exe
    - powerpnt.exe
    - mspub.exe
    - visio.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on macro based approved
  documents in the organization. Filtering may be needed.

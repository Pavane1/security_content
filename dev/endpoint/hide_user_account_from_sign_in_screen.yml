description: This analytic identifies a suspicious registry modification to hide a
  user account on the Windows Login screen. This technique was seen in some tradecraft
  where the adversary will create a hidden user account with Admin privileges in login
  screen to avoid noticing by the user that they already compromise and to persist
  on that said machine.

    TargetObject: '*\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion\\Winlogon\\SpecialAccounts\\Userlist*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as CarbonBlack or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: Unknown. Filter as needed.

description: This analytic looks for the execution of `schtasks.exe` with command-line
  arguments utilized to start a Scheduled Task on a remote endpoint. Red Teams and
  adversaries alike may abuse the Task Scheduler for lateral movement and remote code
  execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: schtasks.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: schtasks.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*/run*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*/s*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may start scheduled tasks on remote systems,
  but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.

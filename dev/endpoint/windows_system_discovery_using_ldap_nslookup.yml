  server name and many more.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: nslookup.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: nslookup.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*_ldap._tcp.dc._msdcs*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from

description: The vssadmin.exe utility is used to interact with the Volume Shadow Copy
  Service.  Wmic is an interface to the Windows Management Instrumentation.  This
  search looks for either of these tools being used to delete shadow copies.

how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
known_false_positives: vssadmin.exe and wmic.exe are standard applications shipped
  with modern versions of windows. They may be used by administrators to legitimately
  delete old backup copies, although this is typically rare.

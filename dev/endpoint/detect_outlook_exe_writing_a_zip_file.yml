how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records filesystem and process activity
  from your hosts to populate the Endpoint data model. This is typically populated
  via endpoint detection-and-response product, such as Carbon Black, or endpoint data
  sources, such as Sysmon.
known_false_positives: It is not uncommon for outlook to write legitimate zip files
  to the disk.

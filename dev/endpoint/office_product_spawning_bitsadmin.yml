type: TTP
description: The following detection identifies the latest behavior utilized by different
  malware families (including TA551, IcedID). This detection identifies any Windows
  Office Product spawning `bitsadmin.exe`. In malicious instances, the command-line
  of `bitsadmin.exe` will contain a URL to a remote destination or similar command-line
  arguments as transfer, Download, priority, Foreground. In addition, Threat Research
  has released a detections identifying suspicious use of `bitsadmin.exe`. In this
  instance, we narrow our detection down to the Office suite as a parent process.
  During triage, review all file modifications. Capture and analyze any artifacts
  on disk. The Office Product, or `bitsadmin.exe` will have reached out to a remote
  destination, capture and block the IPs or domain. Review additional parallel processes
  for further activity.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: No false positives known. Filter as needed.

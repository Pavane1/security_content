description: The following analytic identifies DLLHost.exe with no command line arguments.
  It is unusual for DLLHost.exe to execute with no command line arguments present.
  This particular behavior is common with malicious software, including Cobalt Strike.
  During investigation, identify any network connections and parallel processes. Identify
  any suspicious module loads related to credential dumping or file writes. DLLHost.exe
  is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: dllhost.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: dllhost.exe
  condition: (selection1 or selection2)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.

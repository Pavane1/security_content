type: Anomaly
description: The following analytic identifies suspicious process command line, where
  WMI is performing an event query looking for running processes or running services.
  This technique is commonly found where the adversary will identify services and
  system information on the compromised machine. During triage, review parallel processes
  within the same timeframe. Review the full script block to identify other related
  artifacts.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: wmic.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: wmic.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine:
    - '*process list*'
    - '*service list*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: netowrk administrator or IT may execute this command for auditing
  processes and services.

description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious wscript commandline to execute
  vbscript. This technique was seen in several malware to execute malicious vbs file
  using wscript application. commonly vbs script is associated to cscript process
  and this can be a technique to evade process parent child detections or even some
  av script emulation system.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    ParentCommandLine: '*//e:vbscript*'
    ParentImage: wscript.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*//e:vbscript*'
    Image|endswith: wscript.exe
  condition: selection1 or selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.

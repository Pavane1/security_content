description: The following analytic identifies a process that is attempting to disable
  the ability on Windows to generate a memory crash dump. This was recently identified
  being utilized by HermeticWiper. To disable crash dumps, the value must be set to
  0. This feature is typically modified to perform a memory crash dump when a computer
  stops unexpectedly because of a Stop error (also known as a blue screen, system
  crash, or bug check).

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Filesystem` and `Registry`
  node.

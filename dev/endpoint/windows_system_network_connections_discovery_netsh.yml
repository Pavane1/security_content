description: The following analytic identifies a process execution of Windows OS built-in
  tool netsh.exe to show state, configuration and profile of host firewall. This tool
  is being used or abused by several adversaries or even post exploitation tool to
  bypass firewall rules or to discover firewall settings. This hunting detection can
  help to detect a possible suspicious usage of netsh.exe to retrieve firewall settings
  or even firewall wlan profile. We recommend checking which parent process and process
  name execute this command. Also check the process file path for verification that
  may lead to further TTP's threat behavior.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: netsh.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: netsh.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine:
    - '*state*'
    - '*config*'
    - '*wlan*'
    - '*profile*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '* show *'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances of wermgr.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: network administrator can use this tool for auditing process.

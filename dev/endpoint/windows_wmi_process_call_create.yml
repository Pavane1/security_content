type: Hunting
description: This analytic is to look for wmi commandlines to execute or create process.
  This technique was used by adversaries or threat actor to execute their malicious
  payload in local or remote host. This hunting query is a good pivot to start to
  look further which process trigger the wmi or what process it execute locally or
  remotely.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: wmic.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: wmic.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '* process *'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '* call *'
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '* create *'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4 and selection5
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Administrators may execute this command for testing or auditing.

description: This analytic detects a potential suspicious modification of firewall
  rule registry allowing inbound traffic in specific port with public profile. This
  technique was identified when an adversary wants to grant remote access to a machine
  by allowing the traffic in a firewall rule.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: network admin may add/remove/modify public inbound firewall
  rule that may cause this rule to be triggered.

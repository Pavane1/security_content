name: Windows Java Spawning Shells

status: experimental
type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies the process name of java.exe and w3wp.exe
  spawning a Windows shell. This is potentially indicative of exploitation of the
  Java application and may be related to current event CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell).
  The shells included in the macro are "cmd.exe", "powershell.exe". Upon triage, review
  parallel processes and command-line arguments to determine legitimacy.

search:
  selection1:
    ParentImage:
    - java.exe
    - w3wp.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. Restrict the analytic to publicly facing endpoints to reduce false positives.
  Add any additional identified web application process name to the query. Add any
  further Windows process names to the macro (ex. LOLBins) to further expand this
  query.
known_false_positives: Filtering may be required on internal developer build systems
  or classify assets as web facing and restrict the analytic based on that.

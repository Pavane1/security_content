description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` executing the
  `Get-DomainPolicy` commandlet used to obtain the password policy in a Windows domain.
  Red Teams and adversaries alike may use PowerShell to enumerate domain policies
  for situational awareness and Active Directory Discovery.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*Get-DomainPolicy*'
    Image|endswith:
    - powershell*
    - cmd.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed rundll32.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: Administrators or power users may use this command for troubleshooting.

description: The following analytic identifies DLLHost.exe with no command line arguments
  with a network connection. It is unusual for DLLHost.exe to execute with no command
  line arguments present. This particular behavior is common with malicious software,
  including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, triage any network connections and
  parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads related to credential dumping
  or file writes. DLLHost.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and C:\Windows\syswow64.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith: dllhost.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `port` node.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate third party applications
  may use a moved copy of dllhost, triggering a false positive.

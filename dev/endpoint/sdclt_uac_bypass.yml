data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name:
    - IsolatedCommand
    - (Default)
    TargetObject:
    - '*\\exefile\\shell\\runas\\command\\*'
    - '*\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\App Paths\\control.exe*'
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited to no false positives are expected.

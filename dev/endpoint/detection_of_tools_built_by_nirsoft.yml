description: This search looks for specific command-line arguments that may indicate
  the execution of tools made by Nirsoft, which are legitimate, but may be abused
  by attackers.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '* /stext *'
    - '* /scomma *'
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting endpoint data that tracks process activity,
  including parent-child relationships from your endpoints to populate the Endpoint
  data model in the Processes node. The command-line arguments are mapped to the "process"
  field in the Endpoint data model.
known_false_positives: While legitimate, these NirSoft tools are prone to abuse. You
  should verfiy that the tool was used for a legitimate purpose.

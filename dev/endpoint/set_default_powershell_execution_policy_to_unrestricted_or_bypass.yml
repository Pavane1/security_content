description: Monitor for changes of the ExecutionPolicy in the registry to the values
  "unrestricted" or "bypass," which allows the execution of malicious scripts.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name: ExecutionPolicy
    TargetObject: '*Software\\Microsoft\\Powershell\\1\\ShellIds\\Microsoft.PowerShell*'
    Details:
    - Bypass
    - Unrestricted
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: You must be ingesting data that records process activity from your
  hosts to populate the Endpoint data model in the Registry node. You must also be
  ingesting logs with the fields registry_path, registry_key_name, and registry_value_name
  from your endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may attempt to change the default execution
  policy on a system for a variety of reasons. However, setting the policy to "unrestricted"
  or "bypass" as this search is designed to identify, would be unusual. Hits should
  be reviewed and investigated as appropriate.

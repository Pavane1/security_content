description: This analytic identifies wmic.exe being launched with parameters to spawn
  a process on a remote system. Red Teams and adversaries alike may abuse WMI and
  this binary for lateral movement and remote code execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: wmic.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: wmic.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*process*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*/node:*'
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '*call*'
  selection6:
    CommandLine: '*create*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4 and selection5
    and selection6
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: The wmic.exe utility is a benign Windows application. It may
  be used legitimately by Administrators with these parameters for remote system administration,
  but it's relatively uncommon.

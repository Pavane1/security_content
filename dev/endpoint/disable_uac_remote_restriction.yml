description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious modification of registry to disable
  UAC remote restriction. This technique was well documented in Microsoft page where
  attacker may modify this registry value to bypassed UAC feature of windows host.
  This is a good indicator that some tries to bypassed UAC to suspicious process or
  gain privilege escalation.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name: LocalAccountTokenFilterPolicy
    TargetObject: '*\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System*'
    Details: '0x00000001'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: admin may set this policy for non-critical machine.

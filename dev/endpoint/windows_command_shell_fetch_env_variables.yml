type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies a suspicious process command line fetching
  the environment variables with a non-shell parent process. This technique was seen
  in qakbot malware where it fetches the environment variable in the target or compromised
  host. This TTP detection is a good pivot of possible malicious behavior since the
  command line is executed by a common non-shell process like cmd.exe , powershell.exe
  and many more. This can also be a good sign that the parent process has a malicious
  code injected to it to execute this command.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*cmd /c set'
    - '*cmd.exe /c set'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: shell process that are not included in this search may cause
  False positive. Filter is needed.

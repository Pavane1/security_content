description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to disable
  windows features. These techniques are seen in several ransomware malware to impair
  the compromised host to make it hard for analyst to mitigate or response from the
  attack. Disabling these known features make the analysis and forensic response more
  hard. Disabling these feature is not so common but can still be implemented by the
  administrator for security purposes. In this scenario filters for users that are
  allowed doing this is needed.

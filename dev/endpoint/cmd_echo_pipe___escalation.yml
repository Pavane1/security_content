description: This analytic identifies a common behavior by Cobalt Strike and other
  frameworks where the adversary will escalate privileges, either via `jump` (Cobalt
  Strike PTH) or `getsystem`, using named-pipe impersonation. A suspicious event will
  look like `cmd.exe /c echo 4sgryt3436 > \\.\Pipe\5erg53`.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Unknown. It is possible filtering may be required to ensure
  fidelity.

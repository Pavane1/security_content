description: The following analytic identifies the use of the Windows Disk Image Utility,
  `dism.exe`, to remove Windows Defender. Adversaries may use `dism.exe` to disable
  Defender before completing their objective.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith: dism.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*/disable-feature*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*/online*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*Windows-Defender*'
  selection5:
    CommandLine: '*/remove*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3 and selection4 and selection5
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Some legitimate administrative tools leverage `dism.exe` to
  manipulate packages and features of the operating system. Filter as needed.

description: The search looks for reg.exe modifying registry keys that define Windows
  services and their configurations.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine: '*reg*'
    Image|endswith: reg.exe
  selection2:
    CommandLine: '*add*'
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*Services*'
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.
known_false_positives: It is unusual for a service to be created or modified by directly
  manipulating the registry. However, there may be legitimate instances of this behavior.
  It is important to validate and investigate, as appropriate.

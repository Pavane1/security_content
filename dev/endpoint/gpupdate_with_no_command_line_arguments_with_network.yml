description: The following analytic identifies gpupdate.exe with no command line arguments
  and with a network connection. It is unusual for gpupdate.exe to execute with no
  command line arguments present. This particular behavior is common with malicious
  software, including Cobalt Strike. During investigation, triage any network connections
  and parallel processes. Identify any suspicious module loads related to credential
  dumping or file writes. gpupdate.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\system32 and
  C:\Windows\syswow64.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    Image|endswith: gpupdate.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives may be present in small environments.
  Tuning may be required based on parent process.

  message: Process gpupdate.exe  with parent_process $parent_process_name$ is executed
    on $dest$ by user $user$, followed by an outbound network connection to $connection_to_CNC$
    on port $dest_port$. This behaviour is seen with cobaltstrike.

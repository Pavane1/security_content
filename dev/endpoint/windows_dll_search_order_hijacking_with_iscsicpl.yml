description: The following analytic identifies a recently disclosed search ordler
  DLL hijack in iscsicpl.exe. The malicious DLL must be in a new path and iscsicpl.exe,
  upon load, will execute the payload. The analytic is restricted to Windows shells.
  Two proof of concepts were identified and utilized to determine the behavior. The
  command-line is an option to go after, but most likely identifying a child process
  off iscsicpl.exe will be more effective. Monitoring for suspicious DLL loads is
  also an option.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    ParentImage: iscsicpl.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filtering may be required.
  Remove the Windows Shells macro to determine if other utilities are using iscsicpl.exe.

type: Anomaly
description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to disable
  shutdown button on the logon user. This technique was seen in several malware especially
  in ransomware family like killdisk malware variant to make the compromised host
  un-useful and hard to remove other registry modification made on the machine that
  needs restart to take effect. This windows feature may implement by administrator
  in some server where shutdown is critical. In that scenario filter of machine and
  users that can modify this registry is needed.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Details: '0x00000000'
    TargetObject: '*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\shutdownwithoutlogon'
  selection2:
    Details: '0x00000001'
    TargetObject: '*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\NoClose'
  condition: selection1 or selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: This windows feature may implement by administrator in some
  server where shutdown is critical. In that scenario filter of machine and users
  that can modify this registry is needed.

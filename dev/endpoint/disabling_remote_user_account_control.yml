description: The search looks for modifications to registry keys that control the
  enforcement of Windows User Account Control (UAC).
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Details: '0x00000000'
    TargetObject: '*HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System\\EnableLUA*'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black, or via other endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon.
  The data used for this search is typically generated via logs that report registry
  modifications.
known_false_positives: This registry key may be modified via administrators to implement
  a change in system policy. This type of change should be a very rare occurrence.

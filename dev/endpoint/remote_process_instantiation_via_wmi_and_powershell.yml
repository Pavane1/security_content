description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` leveraging
  the `Invoke-WmiMethod` commandlet complemented with arguments utilized to start
  a process on a remote endpoint by abusing WMI. Red Teams and adversaries alike may
  abuse WMI and `powershell.exe` for lateral movement and remote code execution.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage WWMI and powershell.exe to start
  a process on remote systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set
  of hosts or users.

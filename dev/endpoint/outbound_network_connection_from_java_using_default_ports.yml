description: A required step while exploiting the CVE-2021-44228-Log4j vulnerability
  is that the victim server will perform outbound connections to attacker-controlled
  infrastructure. This is required as part of the JNDI lookup as well as for retrieving
  the second stage .class payload. The following analytic identifies the Java process
  reaching out to default ports used by the LDAP and RMI protocols. This behavior
  could represent successfull exploitation. Note that adversaries can easily decide
  to use arbitrary ports for these protocols and potentially bypass this detection.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Legitimate Java applications may use perform outbound connections
  to these ports. Filter as needed

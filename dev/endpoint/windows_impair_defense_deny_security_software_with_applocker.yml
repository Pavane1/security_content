description: The following analytic identifies a modification in the Windows registry
  by the Applocker utility that contains details or registry data values related to
  denying the execution of several security products. This technique was seen in Azorult
  malware where it drops an xml Applocker policy that will deny several AV products
  and then loaded by using PowerShell Applocker commandlet.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    TargetObject: '*}Machine\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SrpV2*'
  selection2:
    TargetObject: '*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Group Policy Objects\\*'
  selection3:
    Details: '*Action\='
    TargetObject: '*\\Software\\Policies\\Microsoft\\Windows\\SrpV2*'
  condition: (selection1 and selection2) or selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Registry` node. Also make sure
  that this registry was included in your config files ex. sysmon config to be monitored.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on organization use of
  Applocker. Filter as needed.

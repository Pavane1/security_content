description: The following analytic identifies a Microsoft Office product spawning
  the Windows msdt.exe process. MSDT is a Diagnostics Troubleshooting Wizard native
  to Windows. This behavior is related to a recently identified sample utilizing protocol
  handlers to evade preventative controls, including if macros are disabled in the
  document. During triage, review file modifications for html. In addition, parallel
  processes including PowerShell and CertUtil.

description: This analytic is to detect a suspicious registry modification to disable
  logoff feature in windows host. This registry when enable will prevent users to
  log off of the system by using any method, including programs run from the command
  line, such as scripts. It also disables or removes all menu items and buttons that
  log the user off of the system. This technique was seen abused by ransomware malware
  to make the compromised host un-useful and hard to remove other registry modification
  made on the machine that needs restart to take effect. This windows feature may
  implement by administrator in some server where shutdown is critical. In that scenario
  filter of machine and users that can modify this registry is needed.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name:
    - NoLogOff
    - StartMenuLogOff
    TargetObject: '*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\*'
    Details: '0x00000001'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the Filesystem responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` and `Registry` node.
known_false_positives: This windows feature may implement by administrator in some
  server where shutdown is critical. In that scenario filter of machine and users
  that can modify this registry is needed.

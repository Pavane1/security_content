description: This analytic is to detect a registry modification to disable ETW feature
  of windows. This technique is to evade EDR appliance to evade detections and hide
  its execution from audit logs.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 13
search:
  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name: ETWEnabled
    TargetObject: '*\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\.NETFramework*'
    Details: '0x00000000'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

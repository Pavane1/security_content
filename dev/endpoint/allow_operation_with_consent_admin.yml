description: This analytic identifies a potential privilege escalation attempt to
  perform malicious task. This registry modification is designed to allow the `Consent
  Admin` to perform an operation that requires elevation without consent or credentials.
  We also found this in some attacker to gain privilege escalation to the compromise
  machine.
data_source:

  selection1:
    Registry.registry_value_name: ConsentPromptBehaviorAdmin
    TargetObject: '*\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\System*'
    Details: '0x00000000'
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must be ingesting data
  that records registry activity from your hosts to populate the endpoint data model
  in the registry node. This is typically populated via endpoint detection-and-response
  product, such as Carbon Black or endpoint data sources, such as Sysmon. The data
  used for this search is typically generated via logs that report reads and writes
  to the registry.

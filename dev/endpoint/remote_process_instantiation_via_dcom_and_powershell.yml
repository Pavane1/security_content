description: This analytic looks for the execution of `powershell.exe` with arguments
  utilized to start a process on a remote endpoint by abusing the DCOM protocol. Specifically,
  this search looks for the abuse of ShellExecute and ExecuteShellCommand. Red Teams
  and adversaries alike may abuse DCOM and `powershell.exe` for lateral movement and
  remote code execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: pwsh.dll
  selection2:
    Image|endswith:
    - pwsh.exe
    - sqlps.exe
    - sqltoolsps.exe
    - powershell.exe
    - powershell_ise.exe
  selection3:
    OriginalFileName: PowerShell.EXE
  selection4:
    OriginalFileName: powershell_ise.EXE
  selection5:
    CommandLine:
    - '*Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand*'
    - '*Document.Application.ShellExecute*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2 or selection3 or selection4) and selection5
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Administrators may leverage DCOM to start a process on remote
  systems, but this activity is usually limited to a small set of hosts or users.

description: The following hunting analytic identifies the use of `Get-WMIObject Win32_Group`
  being used with PowerShell to identify local groups on the endpoint. \ Typically,
  by itself, is not malicious but may raise suspicion based on time of day, endpoint
  and username. \ During triage, review parallel processes and identify any further
  suspicious behavior.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    processes.process_name: cmd.exe
  selection2:
    Image|endswith: powershell.exe
  selection3:
    CommandLine: '*Win32_Group*'
  selection4:
    CommandLine: '*Get-WMIObject*'
  condition: (selection1 or selection2) and selection3 and selection4
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Tune as needed.

description: this search is to detect a suspicious registry modification to implement
  auto admin logon to a host. This technique was seen in BlackMatter ransomware to
  automatically logon to the compromise host after  triggering a safemode boot to
  continue encrypting the whole network. This behavior is not a common practice and
  really a suspicious TTP or alert need to be consider if found within then network
  premise.

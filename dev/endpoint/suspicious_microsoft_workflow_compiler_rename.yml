description: The following analytic identifies a renamed instance of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe.
  Microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe is natively found in C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319
  and is rarely utilized. When investigating, identify the executed code on disk and
  review. A spawned child process from microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe is uncommon.
  In any instance, microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe spawning from an Office product
  or any living off the land binary is highly suspect.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    OriginalFileName: Microsoft.Workflow.Compiler.exe
    Image|endswith: microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may use a moved
  copy of microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe, triggering a false positive.

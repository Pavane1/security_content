description: This analytic looks for the presence of suspicious commandline parameters
  typically present when using Impacket tools. Impacket is a collection of python
  classes meant to be used with Microsoft network protocols. There are multiple scripts
  that leverage impacket libraries like `wmiexec.py`, `smbexec.py`, `dcomexec.py`
  and `atexec.py` used to execute commands on remote endpoints. By default, these
  scripts leverage administrative shares and hardcoded parameters that can be used
  as a signature to detect its use. Red Teams and adversaries alike may leverage Impackets
  tools for lateral movement and remote code execution.
data_source:
- Sysmon Event ID 1
search:
  selection1:
    CommandLine:
    - '*/c* \\\\127.0.0.1\\*'
    - '*/c* 2>&1'
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints.
known_false_positives: Although uncommon, Administrators may leverage Impackets tools
  to start a process on remote systems for system administration or automation use
  cases.

description: The following analytic identifies the creation of a scheduled task using schtasks.exe, with the flags -create being passed on the command-line along with an XML parameter. This technique has been associated with threat actors, adversaries, and red teamers seeking to gain persistence or achieve privilege escalation on targeted hosts. Notably, the Trickbot and Winter-Vivern malware have been observed employing this method, utilizing an XML file to create scheduled tasks. It is important to monitor and investigate such activity in order to mitigate potential security risks.
search: '| tstats `security_content_summariesonly` count min(_time) as firstTime max(_time) as lastTime from datamodel=Endpoint.Processes 
  where Processes.process_name=schtasks.exe Processes.process=*create* Processes.process="* /xml *"

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible scripts or administrators may trigger this analytic.
  Filter as needed based on parent process, application.

description: The following analytic utilises a known list of vulnerable Windows drivers
  to help defenders find potential persistence or privelege escalation via a vulnerable
  driver. This analytic uses native windows system service install events to capture when the vulnerable driver is installed. 
  A known gap with this lookup is that it does not use the hash or known signer of the vulnerable driver
  therefore it is up to the defender to identify version and signing info and confirm
  it is a vulnerable driver.
  This detection is a winventlog copy of the Sysmon driver loaded detection written by Michael Haag. 
search: '`wineventlog_system` EventCode=7045 ServiceType="kernel mode driver" | table _time dest EventCode ImagePath ServiceName ServiceType | lookup loldrivers driver_name AS ImagePath OUTPUT is_driver driver_description | search is_driver = TRUE  | `windows_vulnerable_driver_installed_filter`'
how_to_implement: Ensure the Splunk is collecting XmlWinEventLog:System events and the EventCode 7045 is being ingested. 
known_false_positives: False positives may be present. Drill down into the driver
  further by version number and cross reference by signer. Review the reference material
  in the lookup.

- Security Event ID 4663
description: The following analytic identifies a non-chrome process accessing Chrome user data "local state" file. 
  This file stores various settings and information related to the browser's operation on your computer. Threat actor, adversaries and malware author 
  also abused this file to attempt to extract the encrypted master key to decrypt password saved in chrome browser.
  This anomaly detection can be a good pivot of analysis for suspicious process aside from chrome.exe and explorer.exe executable.

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you must ingest Windows Security
  Event logs and track event code 4663. For 4663, enable "Audit Object Access" in
  Group Policy. Then check the two boxes listed for both "Success" and "Failure."
known_false_positives: Uninstall chrome application may access this file and folder path to removed chrome installation in target host. Filter is needed.

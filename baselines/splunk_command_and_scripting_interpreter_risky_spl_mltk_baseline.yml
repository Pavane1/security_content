datamodel:
- Splunk_Audit
description: 'This search supports an analyst looking for abuse or misuse of the risky commands listed here: https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Security/SPLsafeguards#Commands_that_trigger_the_warning
This is accomplished by using the time spent executing one of these risky commands as a proxy for misuse/abuse of interest during investigation and/or hunting.
The search builds a model utilizes the MLTK DensityFunction algorithm on Splunk app audit log data. The model uses the past 7 days of user history executing the above referenced commands then aggregates the total search run time for each hour as indicator of user behavior.
The model identifies the top 0.1% of user search run time, indicating a risky use of these commands. Users can adjust this threshold 0.1% as interested however this will correlate to missed/false positive rates. This search should be scheduled to run at least every 7 days. The name of machine learning model generated is "risky_command_abuse" and should be configured to be globally shared (not private) in MLTK app as documented here:
https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/5.3.1/User/Models#Sharing_models_from_other_Splunk_apps
unless the same account of training this model will be used to perform inference using this model for anomaly
detection.'

how_to_implement: The corresponding detection of using this model is "Splunk Command and Scripting Interpreter Risky 
  SPL MLTK". This detection depends on MLTK app which can be found here - https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/2890/
  and it assumes Splunk accelerated audit data model is available. For large enterprises, training the model might 
  take significant computing resources. It might require dedicated search head. The underlined machine learning 
  algorithm this detection used is DensityFunction. It might need to increase its settings default values, such as 
  max_fit_time, max_groups, etc. More details of achieving optimal performance and configuring DensityFunction 
  parameters can be found here - https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/MLApp/5.3.1/User/Configurefitandapply
  Users can modify earliest=-7d@d in the search to other value so that the search can collect enough data points 
  to build a good baseline model. Users can also modify list of risky commands in "Search_Activity.search IN" to better
  suit users' violation policy and their usage environment.
known_false_positives: If the run time of a search exceeds the boundaries of outlier defined by the fitted density 
  function model, false positives can occur, incorrectly labeling a long running search as potentially risky.
